# Tic_Tac_Toe
This project was part of an assignment in Module 16 of the MIT Full Stack development course. The concepts illustrated in the Module were the use of React's useState along with the concept of passing information from Parent to Child components and vice versa. 

# Roadmap of future improvements
1) Modify the styles.css file to apply colors which are a little cleaner and easier on the eyes. 

2) Provide text boxes for players to enter their names. Ensure that the next player prompts reflect the players names accordingly rather than using "Player X" and "Player O"

3) Prevent a square from being editable after it was been marked by setting a "marked" property on the individual squares once marked. 

4) When a winner is determined, highlight all of the squares which make up the winning series of squares with a unique color
